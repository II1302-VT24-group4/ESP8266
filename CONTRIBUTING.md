## 🌿 Branching Strategy

All code changes should be made in a separate branch. This helps us keep the main branch clean and stable. Here are the steps to create a new branch:

1. Fetch the latest version of the main branch.
2. Create a new branch from the main branch.
3. Make your changes in this new branch.

## 🔄 Pull Requests

Once you've made your changes in a separate branch, you can merge them into the main branch using a pull request (PR). Here are the steps to create a PR:

1. Push your branch to the remote repository.
2. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
3. In the "Branch" menu, choose the branch that contains your commits.
4. To the right of the Branch menu, click "New pull request".
5. Provide a title and description for your PR.
6. Review the changes and click "Create pull request".

Please ensure that your code has been thoroughly tested before submitting a PR. All PRs will be reviewed before merging.
